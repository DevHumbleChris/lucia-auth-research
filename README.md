# Lucia Auth Research

This repository contains research on implementing Lucia auth in various projects and applications, including Express, Nuxt.js, and Next.js.

## Introduction

Lucia is an authentication library for your server that abstracts away the complexity of handling sessions. It works alongside your database to provide an API that's easy to use, understand, and extend. This research aims to explore the integration of Lucia auth into different frameworks and platforms.

## Getting Started

To get started with Lucia auth in your project, follow the instructions below based on your chosen framework:

- **Express**: Refer to the `express-lucia` directory for implementation details and setup instructions.

- **Nuxt.js**: Follow the instructions in the `nuxt-lucia` directory to integrate Lucia auth into your Nuxt.js application.

- **Next.js**: For Next.js integration, check out the `next-lucia` directory for implementation details.

## Directory Structure

- `express-lucia/`: Contains research and implementation of Lucia auth in an Express application.
  
- `nuxt-lucia/`: Research and implementation of Lucia auth in a Nuxt.js application.

- `next-lucia/`: Research and implementation of Lucia auth in a Next.js application.
